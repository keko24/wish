In this repository you will find the code for a basic shell (command-line interpreter), which I wrote as part of learning more about operating systems for my course at university. It is written purely in C, and currently it supports most shell commands with cd, path, and exit being built-in, while also being able to redirect standard output to a file and run commands in parallel. To try using it, you can compile it with any dedicated compiler, run it, and it should work on any system.
